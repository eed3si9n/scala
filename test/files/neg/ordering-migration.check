ordering-migration.scala:3: warning: object DeprecatedFloatOrdering in object Ordering has changed semantics in version 2.13.0:
  The new ordering does not affect the sorting, placing NaN at the end.
  However, methods such as `lt`, `min`, and `equiv` now match `compare`
  instead of giving IEEE 754 behavior for -0.0F and NaN.
  Import Ordering.Float.IeeeOrdering to retain the previous behavior.
